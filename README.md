# after_spor

A new Flutter project. My first time working with Flutter...

Fun project just to cure the boredom...

I wanna code a platform where soccer fans from all around the world can gather around and talk about anything they want.

The main idea is that the user joins the App/Website and selects its favourite team. After that, he will be given the option to choose between several chat rooms which vary in size.

He can choose whether he wants to join a smaller group or a bigger group.

Basically a possibility for soccer fans to find their own and discuss questionable penalty decisions after a game or just a way to make new friends.

It could also be an opportunity for the fans to mock the fan base of the rivals (not my main intention but would be funny to see the world burn :-) ).

For example: Galatasaray beats Fenerbahce. The Galatasaray fan could perhaps join the chat room of Fenerbahce to just to sing the main anthem and undermine their loss. :-)
